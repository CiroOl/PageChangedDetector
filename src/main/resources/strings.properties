WELCOME_LABEL=This program is really simple, so far. You can choose a target site you want to keep an eye on and it will look for changes in its HTML body and then it will notify you that! In this first version, PageChangedDetector recognizes as a change also different tokens in <script> tag. If you want to help me to improve its quality, contact me please :)
TARGET_SITE_LABEL=It's time to select your target site: you can only choose sites with no authentication needed, so far. 
RESEARCH_INTERVAL_LABEL=PageChangedDetector needs a research interval: it will perform its detection with regular intervals. The value you'll select is 'in seconds': the system prevents more frequent searches to avoid bans.
NOTIFICATION_METHODS_LABEL=Please, now select at least one notification method.\nIf you want to receive a mail when your target site changes, you have to be logged in. So far you can only use an hotmail account: the system will send a message to the same email used to send it.

TARGET_SITE_FOUND=Target site found: are your sure you want to detect this site? Have a look in your default browser!
TARGET_SITE_UNREACHABLE=It seems your target site is unreachable
CHECK_CONNECTIVITY_AND_URL=Please, check your connectivity state and the URL you entered

ILLEGAL_RESEARCH_INTERVAL=Illegal research interval: must be a number greater than 1
PLEASE_INSERT_VALID_VALUE=Please, insert a valid value and retry
